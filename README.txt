School assignment for OsloMet - Storbyuniversitet for the course ITPE3200 - Webapplcations.
This is the 2nd assignment in a series of developing modules and pages for a Flight booking system with.NET,using
WebAPI and MVC like this one.  This assignment was graded with an B, and recieved good feedback for comprehensive testing, which is the reason why we decided to publish the code on Github. 


The webapplication "was" published on Azure but removed due to limites databases with student licences.
